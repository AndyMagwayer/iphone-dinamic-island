IN this Github page you can see the inovation of apple goods it is available now only on Ihones like Iphone 14 Pro and on Iphone 14 Pro Max

this website done for educational purposes and do want to blame or offense somebody/

Dynamic Island is a big surprise and the top feature of 2022 from Apple. I don't like to throw big words around, but the first thing I thought of was "It's revolution, Johnny" or something like that :)

At yesterday's Apple presentation, among other things, a new feature of the older series of iPhones was shown – Dynamic Island – such a working area around a round bang, the implementation of which became possible due to the reduction of the front camera.

The presentation briefly showed how it will be used, but it is already clear that some system notifications and actions will be embedded in the island, which previously were revealed to the full screen, occupying an unreasonably large space. It is also not yet clear whether standard push notifications will be built into the island, or whether they will retain the same appearance. Now it is only clear that the push of a phone call, the use of Face ID, and the connection of headphones will definitely be written into the concept of the island. Typical actions will be shown in a collapsed form, and if you want to get more information, the user will be able to click on the island.

Dynamic Island is a function at the interface and engineering interface that perfectly describes the phrase "not a bug, but a feature". Previously, bangs were a problem that did not participate in user interaction in any way. It was clear to everyone that this was a temporary crutch solution that would eventually come to an end. The island, judging by the video, will take over part of the application interface in order to create additional space for placing data, contacts with the user and simplifying actions. Also, due to the fact that the push buttons will be located higher and the island will become an intuitive zone for some type of action, the iPhone's working area will expand and the time of using the smartphone may be reduced. Conceptually, it's very similar to TouchBar.

Cautiously, we can say that Dynamic Island is the invention of a new way of interacting with the user on a par with push notifications on the iPhone and TouchBar on the Mac. Therefore, it is extremely interesting how it will work: the functioning of the island directly depends on how application developers will implement some functions into it. And, as we know from experience, the TouchBar did not fly, although it also made noise at the time. There is no information for developers about Dynamic Island on the Apple website yet, so we will wait for more data on what information can be placed on the island for application developers and what actions users will be able to perform.

Have you already imagined how you could use the island for your application? Write in the comments!
